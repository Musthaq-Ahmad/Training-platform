          'Password Length * Minimum length for passwords should be enforced by the application. * If MFA is enabled passwords shorter than 8 characters are considered to be weak (NIST SP800-63B). * If MFA is not enabled passwords shorter than 15 characters are considered to be weak (NIST SP800-63B). * Maximum password length should be at least 64 characters to allow passphrases (NIST SP800-63B). Note that certain implementations of hashing algorithms may cause long password denial of service. * Longer passphrases are effective because they raise the number of guesses an attacker\'s dictionary or wordlist has to cover, not because of a precise entropy value: NIST notes that "estimating entropy for user-chosen passwords is challenging" and recommends length and blocklist checks (see below) over composition or entropy math (NIST SP800-63B, Strength of Passwords). Entropy estimates rely on assumptions about the search space and should be treated as illustrative rather than as absolute measures of password strength. * Attackers commonly use password guessing techniques that leverage common-password dictionaries and password lists, and may use previously compromised credentials in credential stuffing attacks. These behaviors are reflected in MITRE ATT&CK T1110 – Brute Force, including Password Guessing, Password Spraying, and Credential Stuffing. Screening passwords against blocklists helps prevent users from selecting passwords that are commonly used or already known to attackers, as recommended by NIST SP 800-63B – Passwords.',

          'Allow usage of all characters including unicode and whitespace. There should be no password composition rules limiting the type of characters permitted. There should be no requirement for upper or lower case or numbers or special characters.',
          'Ensure credential rotation when a password leak occurs, at the time of compromise identification or when authenticator technology changes. Avoid requiring periodic password changes; instead, encourage users to pick strong passwords and enable Multifactor Authentication Cheat Sheet (MFA). According to NIST guidelines, verifiers should not mandate arbitrary password changes (e.g., periodically).',
