# Vinkup — Local setup guide

How to get Vinkup running on your laptop, from a fresh clone to a signed-in trainee on the real API.
There are two ways to run it:

| Mode           | What runs                                          | Needs                                                    | Time        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| **Mock mode**  | Frontend only, with a fake API inside the browser  | Node.js                                                  | ~5 minutes  |
| **Full stack** | Frontend + backend + database, real Google sign-in | Node.js, a PostgreSQL database, Google OAuth credentials | ~30 minutes |

Mock mode is enough for most frontend work. Use full stack when you work on the backend, the database
or anything that has to behave exactly like production.

## 1. What's in the repo

```
training-platform/
├── frontend/          React + Vite app (pages, components, in-browser runtimes)
├── backend/           Express API, Prisma schema, migrations, seed
│   ├── prisma/        schema.prisma, migrations/, seed-data/curriculum.json
│   ├── prisma7.config.ts

├── docs/              conventions.md — how we write code; read it once
└── netlify.toml       Frontend deploy settings per environment
```

It's an npm workspaces monorepo: one `npm install` at the root installs everything.

## 2. Prerequisites

| Tool           | Version                       | Check with                                                       |
| -------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node.js        | 22 or later                   | `node -v`                                                        |
| npm            | comes with Node (10 or later) | `npm -v`                                                         |
| Git            | any recent                    | `git --version`                                                  |
| Chrome or Edge | recent                        | — (Node.js tasks need it; Safari and older Firefox may not work) |

For full stack you also need:

- **A PostgreSQL database for development.** A free [Neon](https://neon.tech) project is the easiest. A
  local PostgreSQL works too.
- **Google OAuth client ID and secret.** Ask the team member who manages the Google Cloud project; don't
  create your own unless asked.
- **Your company email in the trainee list** (see §5.4), or you can't sign in.

Recommended editor: VS Code with the **ESLint** and **Prettier** extensions. The repo's
`.vscode/settings.json` formats on save and fixes lint issues automatically.

## 3. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Musthaq-Ahmad/Training-platform.git
cd Training-platform
npm install
```

`npm install` at the root also:

- installs the frontend, backend and shared types workspaces;
- runs `prisma generate` for the backend (creates `backend/src/generated/prisma`; never commit it);
- sets up the Git hooks (Husky) that check every commit.

Always run `npm install` from the **repo root**, not inside `frontend/` or `backend/`.

## 4. Quick start: mock mode

1. Create `frontend/.env.local`:

   ```bash
   VITE_USE_MOCKS=true
   VITE_API_URL=""
   ```

2. Start the frontend:

   ```bash
   npm run dev:frontend
   ```

3. Open <http://localhost:5173> in Chrome or Edge and click **Enter fullscreen** when asked.

In mock mode you are signed in automatically as a sample trainee, and every API call is answered inside
the browser from fixtures. Saved code and progress live only in memory (journal entries persist in
`localStorage`), so a page reload resets them. Mock task scenarios such as `/tasks/t-node` and
`/tasks/t-sql` are listed in `frontend/src/api/mockTasks/scenarios.ts`.

**Mock mode must never be on in production.** It is controlled per environment in `netlify.toml`; don't
put `VITE_USE_MOCKS` in `package.json` scripts.

## 5. Full stack

### 5.1 Create a development database

On Neon: create a project (region Singapore is closest), open **Connect**, turn **Connection pooling
off** and copy the connection string. It looks like:

```
postgresql://user:password@ep-xxxx.ap-southeast-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require
```

Use your own development database — never the production one.

### 5.2 Configure the backend

Copy the example and fill it in:

```bash
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

| Variable               | Local value                                                                                              | Notes                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NODE_ENV`             | `development`                                                                                            |                                                                                                      |

| `SESSION_SECRET`       | any random string, 32+ characters                                                                        | `openssl rand -hex 32`                                                                               |

| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`     | from the team                                                                                            |                                                                                                      |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | from the team                                                                                            | Never commit it                                                                                      |

| `ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN` | `vonnue.com`                                                                                             | No `@`                                                                                               |
| `FRONTEND_URL`         | `http://localhost:5173`                                                                                  | Where sign-in sends you back                                                                         |

The backend checks these at startup and refuses to start with a clear message if one is missing or too
short. `backend/.env` is git-ignored.

### 5.3 Create the tables

The Prisma config file in this repo is named `prisma7.config.ts`, so pass it explicitly:

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate deploy --config prisma7.config.ts
cd ..
```

`migrate deploy` applies the existing migrations in `backend/prisma/migrations`. When you change
`schema.prisma`, create a new migration instead:

```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name short_description --config prisma7.config.ts
```

If two PRs both add migrations, the second one to merge pulls `main` and runs `migrate dev` again.

### 5.4 Load the curriculum and trainees

```bash
npm run db:seed -w backend
```

This loads the 8 courses, 54 days and 260 tasks from `backend/prisma/seed-data/curriculum.json`, and
the trainee list at the top of `backend/src/lib/seed.ts`. Only people in that list can sign in; if your
email isn't there, add it (in a PR) and run the seed again. The seed is safe to run any number of times.

To get a realistic account to test with (HTML and CSS days 1–2 done, CSS Day 3 open, some activity and
typing results):

```bash
SEED_DEMO=true DEMO_TRAINEE_EMAIL=you@vonnue.com npm run db:seed -w backend
```

`SEED_DEMO` is for development only; the seed refuses it when `NODE_ENV=production`.

### 5.5 Point the frontend at the real API

Edit `frontend/.env.local`:

```bash
VITE_USE_MOCKS=false
VITE_API_URL=""
```

Vite only reads env files at startup: restart `npm run dev:frontend` after changing them.

### 5.6 Run both

In two terminals from the repo root:

```bash
npm run dev:backend    # API on http://localhost:3000
npm run dev:frontend   # app on http://localhost:5173
```

Check the API: <http://localhost:3000/api/health> shows `{"status":"ok"}`.

Open <http://localhost:5173>, sign in with your company Google account, enter fullscreen, and the
dashboard loads your real progress. In development, Vite forwards every `/api` request to the backend,
so the app and API behave like one site and the login cookie works without extra setup.

## 6. Tests and checks

| Command                                   | What it does                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run test`                            | Unit tests for all workspaces (Vitest)                           |
| `npm run test -w frontend` / `-w backend` | Unit tests for one workspace                                     |
| `npm run test:api -w backend`             | API contract tests: real HTTP calls against a real test database |
| `npx tsc -b frontend backend`             | Type check                                                       |
| `npm run lint` / `npm run lint:fix`       | ESLint                                                           |
| `npm run format`                          | Prettier on the whole repo                                       |

**API contract tests** wipe their database, so they need a **separate** one:

1. Create a second database (a second Neon project or branch).
2. Put its connection string in `backend/.env.test`:

   ```bash
   TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
   ```

3. Apply the migrations to it:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   DATABASE_URL="<the TEST_DATABASE_URL>" npx prisma migrate deploy --config prisma7.config.ts
   ```

4. Run `npm run test:api -w backend`. Add file names to run a subset, e.g.
   `npm run test:api -w backend -- tasks journal`.

The tests refuse to run if `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is the same as `DATABASE_URL`, so your development data is
safe.

## 7. Day-to-day workflow

1. Update `main` and branch from it: `feat/day-unlock`, `fix/paste-block`, `chore/eslint-setup`.
2. Commit with a conventional message, enforced by commitlint:

   ```
   feat(tasks): add submit endpoint
   fix: block paste in the terminal
   ```

   Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore` (plus `style`, `perf`, `build`, `ci`,
   `revert`). Header up to 100 characters.

3. Every commit runs the pre-commit hook: lint-staged (ESLint + Prettier on staged files), the type
   check for frontend and backend, and the unit tests. A failing hook means the commit didn't happen; fix
   the issue and commit again. Don't skip hooks.
4. Push and open a pull request; the template in `.github/pull_request_template.md` fills in. Every PR
   needs one approval. Netlify builds a preview link for each PR (it runs in mock mode).
5. Pull `main` into your branch at least once a day.

Coding rules — module layout, errors, validation, shared types, naming — are in
[`docs/conventions.md`](docs/conventions.md). Read "The 10 rules" at the top before your first PR.
